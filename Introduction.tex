\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}

Readers will be familiar with Wikipedia, free/libre/open source software (FLOSS), and StackExchange.  In the Peeragogy project, we are interested in understanding and exploring ``how that all works.''    We want to build upon these inspiring examples to help design the future of education.  Toward this end, we've developed peeragogy as a model for peer produced peer learning.

We have found design patterns tremendously useful for organizing our thinking about these matters.  However, there is a key difference between our pattern catalog and previous collections of design patterns that touch on similar domains -- like \emph{Liberating Voices: A Pattern Language for Communication Revolution} \cite{schuler2008liberating} and \emph{Pedagogical Patterns: Advice for Educators} \cite{bergin2012pedagogical}.  Our pattern catalog is more action-oriented, and it evolves as the project evolves.   
% Between \emph{describing} and \emph{prescribing} there is a third pragmatic option, which is the one we tend to prefer: \emph{doing}.  

Nevertheless, there are clear precedents for this way of working within the design pattern tradition.  A quite convincing implementation of Alexanderâ€™s idea of patterns as a ``living language'' \cite[p.~xvii]{alexander1977pattern} was realized with one of the earliest applications of wiki software developed by Ward Cunningham: the Portland Pattern Repository. What we've developed is a further iteration of this idea. To use a visual metaphor, whereas other pattern languages are mostly top-down, ours is bottom-up.  That is, structure is explicitly emergent.  These features are built into our pattern template and the way we use the pattern catalog.  This style of project management is suitable for a project that itself has emergent structure.

While we are currently focusing on design, not programming, we do use a lot software tools in order to work together.  Many of the patterns described in this paper were first shared in a private Drupal forum, and were first made public on a Wordpress blog as part of our \emph{Peeragogy Handbook} \cite{peeragogy-handbook}.\footnote{\url{http://peeragogy.org}}  They were then discussed via gMail, Google+, and Google Hangouts, ``hive edited'' in real time on Google Docs, format-shifted with pandoc, typeset with XeLaTeX, hive edited again with ShareLaTeX, and then moved into Github and bridged to Authorea for final edits.  Along the way, some of the patterns made an appearance at a PhD thesis defense \cite{corneli-thesis}, and the pattern template was revised and revised again.  

%% The authors are part of a shifting, globally distributed, team of volunteers with around 30 major contributors, and a long tail with over 1000 members.\footnote{\url{https://plus.google.com/communities/107386162349686249470}} 
We believe this document will be useful for students and educators who want their work to have real-world relevance, and to activists who want to develop practicable solutions to large-scale problems.   Our approach to emergent organization will also be of interest to theorists of social interaction in fields like organization studies and, increasingly, computer science.  The next section introduces the \patternname{Peeragogy Project} in the form of a design pattern.  Sections \ref{sec:Roadmap}--\ref{sec:Scrapbook} list the main patterns in our catalog.  Section \ref{sec:Distributed_Roadmap} summarizes the outlook.  Figure \ref{fig:connections} shows connections between the patterns.
