\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item The key difference between other examples and our
patterns is we're making them explicitly action-oriented.  What I mean
is that other people use design patterns to talk about general
solutions, whereas we have both general and specific-to-us aspects.
\item Readers will certainly have heard of Wikipedia, open source
software, and StackExchange -- and who hopefully will be interested in
any claim to be able to say something about ``how that all works.''
\item We are not focusing on software or programming aspects, but we
are really very good at working with distributed teams of volunteers and
at envisioning the future of education (and definitely we're using
computers).
