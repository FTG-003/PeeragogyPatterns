\section{Audit}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Context:} Our collection of patterns grows.

\textbf{Problem:} They are not all equally relevant.

\textbf{Solution:} Periodically run a pattern audit.  Bring in a real-time aspect using the Paragogical Action Review.  Any patterns that can't be made relevant for our current interests can be moved to the \emph{Scrapbook}

\textbf{Rationale:} We want to keep the attention focused on the most relevant issues.

\textbf{Resolution:} Writing this down helps us describe our effort to focus.

\textbf{What's Next:} Get some practice with the \emph{Audit} pattern in our next meeting.
