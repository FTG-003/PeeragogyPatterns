\section{Scrapbook: Below This Line}

\paragraph{Context:} We've been working with the pattern catalog for a while.
\paragraph{Problem:} We've created more patterns than we can keep track of.
\paragraph{Solution:} We'll create a ``Scrapbook'' for patterns that are no longer part of the active catalog, including any for which there are no more ``what's next'' steps.
\paragraph{Rationale:} We want to look at the ways we used to think about things.
\paragraph{Resolution:} For now, any patterns below this line can be considered part of the Scrapbook.  In particular, we're ``retiring'' the anti-patterns, in order to keep things simple.
\paragraph{What's next:} Can we restore the key ideas from the anti-pattern collection as \emph{actual} patterns?
