\section{Scrapbook} \label{sec:Scrapbook}

\subsubsection*{Context} We've maintained and revised our pattern catalog over a period of years.

\subsubsection*{Problem} Some of the patterns don't seem to lead to concrete next steps.

\subsubsection*{Solution} We've created a \patternname{Scrapbook} for patterns that are no longer part of the active catalog.\footnote{See \url{http://paragogy.net/Pattern_Scrapbook}.  Note that the patterns in our scrapbook use a slightly different template to the one we've currently adopted.}  It's worth remembering how we got to the point we're at now, and the thinking that developed along the way, so the \patternname{Scrapbook} shows some patterns that seemed like a good idea at the time -- and brief notes about why we no longer need them explicitly.  We can use the \patternname{Pattern Audit Routine} to decide when to move a pattern into the \patternname{Scrapbook}.

\subsubsection*{Rationale} We want our collection of patterns to be concretely useful and actively used.  It needs to be clear and pragmatic, and not overly theoretical or precriptive.  If we don't see ``what's next'' and where it came from, then it's probably time to shift focus to something else more practical.

\subsubsection*{Resolution}  After noticing that the idea of a \patternname{Scrapbook} can help us focus and help us present our work to others, we've decided to ``retire'' several patterns that seemed overly abstract or redundant as well as several antipatterns that didn't suggest concrete next steps, and instead simply held a prism to our collective frustrations with the slow pace of a distributed volunteer project.\footnote{Retired patterns: \patternname{Discerning a pattern}, \patternname{Polling for ideas}, \patternname{Moderation}, \patternname{Roles}. Retired antipatterns: \patternname{Isolation}, \patternname{Magical thinking}, \patternname{Messy with Lurkers}, \patternname{Misunderstanding Power}, \patternname{Navel Gazing}, \patternname{Stasis}, \patternname{Stuck at the Level of Weak Ties}.}  The current catalog is leaner and redescribes our project in an action-oriented way. 

\subsubsection*{What's next} After significantly pruning back the pattern catalog, we want it to grow again: new patterns are needed.  Reviewing the contents of the \patternname{Scrapbook} will be one place to look for inspiration, but there are others.
