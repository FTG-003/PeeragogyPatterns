\section{Peeragogy Projects}\label{sec:Peeragogy_Project}
% DK: I question whether the Peeragogy Project is a pattern, or an instance of a pattern. We generally think about patterns as something that can be instantiated. But your project seems like a specific case of the concept.

\subsubsection*{Context}  Architectual maverick Christopher Alexander asked the following questions to an audience of computer programmers \cite{alexander1999origins}: 
\begin{quote}
``What is the Chartres of programming? What task is at a high enough level to inspire people writing programs, to reach for the stars?''
\end{quote}
We believe that the nexus of learning and computers -- exemplified today by projects like Wikipedia, StackExchange, and Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) -- presents an implicit challenge to the old way of doing things in education.  Taking up that challenge and building a new model is reaching \emph{ad astra per aspera}.  

\subsubsection*{Problem} In a volunteer context, telling people what to do really doesn't work.  So we need another way to communicate.  Furthermore, everyone involved in these projects seems to be learning all the time.  So the way we communicate needs to be adaptive to circumstances.

\subsubsection*{Solution} Christopher Alexander introduced the idea of \emph{design patterns} -- using a simple template to describe and shape the human life world.  In our context, design patterns allow us to bridge physical and virtual, move from fantastic to concrete and back.  We've made a few minor alterations to Alexander's original template in order to use patterns in a project that is always changing.  In addition to the traditional \emph{context}/\emph{problem}/\emph{solution} and \emph{rationale}, we try to make it clear what the very act of documenting each pattern \emph{resolves}, and we record the ``\emph{What's next}'' steps we have planned, in order to make the currently acting forces explicit. As time goes by we revise.  Like Alexander, we cross-reference our patterns to understand the links between them. The \patternname{Peeragogy Project} is itself an up-to-date example of Alexander's \patternname{Network of Learning} \cite[p. 99]{alexander1977pattern}.

\subsubsection*{Rationale}
% DK: I have written many, and shepherded many more, and I donâ€™t think this is the case. However, the effort that goes into writing them makes them more intuitive to read :+)
Patterns are intuitive to write and read. Our specific interpretation of the framework helps everyone involved integrate what they are learning.  We can use our design pattern catalog to scaffold our work on other parts of the project -- our technical platform, our Handbook, our meetings -- and to connect with others.  

\subsubsection*{Resolution}  
Writing down this pattern defines some of the key terms for \patternname{Newcomers}, and shows how to use the pattern template introduced schematically above.  Together with Figure \ref{fig:connections}, this pattern begins to show how we are affected by using patterns to build emergent structure.

\subsubsection*{What's next} 
Feel free to join us and suggest new patterns and projects, or adapt our patterns to help shape your own \patternname{Peeragogy Project}.\footnote{In the present document, the term Peeragogy Project, written in a standard font, refers to a current historical, real-world, example of the \patternname{Peeragogy Project} pattern. This project has been active since it was convened by Howard Rheingold \cite{howard-rheingold-lecture}. In order to enhance the readability of our patterns for a general audience, \emph{examples} drawn from our experiences in the Peeragogy Project and related projects appear in footnotes, rather than the pattern template as such.}
