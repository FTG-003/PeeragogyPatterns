\section{Newcomer}
\paragraph{Context:}
A lot of ``education'' assumes we are speaking to a new generation. 
In learning more broadly, the ``audience'' is often new to the topic.
Sometimes we are the newcomers, sometimes we're the oldtimers.

\paragraph{Problem:} Newcomers can feel overwhelmed by the amount of things to learn.  They
don't know where to start.\footnote{\textbf{R\'egis Barondeau}: ``I joined this handbook project late, making me
a `newcomer'. When I started to catch up, I rapidly faced doubts:
Where do I start? How can I help? How will I make it, having to read
more than 700 posts to catch up? What tools are we using ? How do I use
them? Etc. Although this project is amazingly interesting, catching the
train while it already reached high speed can be an extreme sport. By
taking care of newcomers, we might avoid losing valuable contributors
because they don't know how and where to start, and keep our own project
on track.}  They also may have a bunch of ideas that the oldtimers have
never considered.

\paragraph{Solution:} It is good to try to become aware of what a newcomer
needs, and what their motivations are.\footnote{\textbf{Charlotte Pierce}: ``Joe was working
a lot on the book, and I thought `this is interesting hard work, and he shouldn't have to do
this alone.' As a Peeragogy newcomer, I was kindly welcomed and
mentored by Joe, Howard, Fabrizio, and others. I asked naive questions
and was met with patient answers, guiding questions, and resource links.
Concurrently, I bootstrapped myself into a position to contribute to the
workflow by editing the live manuscript for consistency, style, and continuity.''}

\paragraph{Rationale:} Newcomers in the Peeragogy project have often complained
about feeling confused about what the project is about, suggesting that our \emph{Roadmap}
has not been sufficiently clear.  Some feel it is too theoretical, which suggests
we need to do more work on \emph{Creating a guide} on ways to get involved, while also
making it clear that we do not have an exhaustive list in mind.  The ideas that newcomers
have can prompt us to consider how we may have been limiting ourselves.\footnote{Dilrukshi Gamage, Julia Echeverria, and Federico Monaco first joined a Peeragogy hangout in February, 2015.  They were all interested in the idea of designing and running a course on peer learning.  Although we had done some work on a syllabus, we hadn't tried  running a formal course before.}

\paragraph{Resolution:}
This sort of frustration and confusion is familiar to anyone who is starting something new.

\paragraph{What's Next:} We recently revised the ``How to Get Involved''
page, listing the top ten sites we use. Another reasonable thing to post
would be a top-ten list of activities, so that people can get an easier
view on the kinds of things we do in the project.
