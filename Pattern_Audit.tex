\section{Pattern Audit}\label{sec:Pattern_Audit}

\subsubsection*{Context} Our collection of patterns grows.

\subsubsection*{Problem} This becomes confusing.  Not all of the patterns are equally relevant.

\subsubsection*{Solution} Periodically run a pattern audit.  Bring in a real-time aspect using the Paragogical Action Review.  Any patterns that can't be made relevant for our current interests can be moved to the \emph{Scrapbook}

\subsubsection*{Rationale} We want to keep the attention focused on the most relevant issues.

\subsubsection*{Resolution} Writing this down helps us describe our effort to focus.

\subsubsection*{What's Next} Get some practice with the \emph{Audit} pattern in our next meeting.
