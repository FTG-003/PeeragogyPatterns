% Produce versus ???
\section{Use or make}
\paragraph{Context:}
% learning?
Peer production, as the name indicates, is about producing, in other words --
``making.'' But it also involves building on the work of others.

\paragraph{Problem:}
People are often very attached to their own projects and don't have a sense of how the project can benefit from connecting with others.

\paragraph{Solution:} Learning actually involves recycling and remixing people's ideas and techniques. Always remix!

\paragraph{Rationale:} 
Many project die because the cost of reinventing the wheel is too high.
We've had interesting conversations recently about
the role of open source software in peeragogy. Most project participants
agree that the open source ideals are more important than strictly using
open source software for everything. Some feel that it would be best if
we create an open source alternative for any proprietary systems we use.
The debate has been an interesting and largely fruitful one: it's
mentioned here to point out that there's usually no one right answer to
``reuse'' questions.

\paragraph{Resolution:} Writing this down reminds us to always consider repurposing things.

\paragraph{What's Next:} ``Platform'' debates can be frustrating but can
also add something to a project in the long term, since they help people
become aware of their priorities. As mentioned in
the \href{http://peeragogy.org/patterns/newcomer/}{Newcomer} pattern,
developing a more clear picture of the activities that we engage in in
the project will help make it comprehensible to others. It will also be
useful for us to have a clearer picture of what we do, and what we make.

use, as distinct from poesis which designates fabrication. Only the
former, which plays and acts, but does not produce, is noble.'' {[}1{]}
